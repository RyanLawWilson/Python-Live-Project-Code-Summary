What did you do on Friday?
On Friday, I spent some time building the modal used to delete a record from my database for story #5.  This morning I finished the editing part of story #5.

What will you do today?
Today I will complete story #6a to get my API going.  I've looked at it a bit and it doesn't seem too bad so if I may start on 7a if I have time.

Are there any impediments in your way?
No roadblocks right now.
