<h1>Python-Live-Project-Code-Summary</h1>

This is a summary of what I did with a team of programmers with Django

I was part of a team that developed apps to users collect various things.  This was a two week long sprint using the Django framework and PyCharm.  My web application was designed to search for and store Amiibos.  It was a rough start getting used to Django.  I spent a couple days trying to figure everything out and make simple things work.  After that starting period, I started to implement my app idea by completing many front-end and back-end stories.  For the front-end, I was able to create several features: a table that displays the user's collection, a list of Amiibos from an API, and recent news from a Nintendo news site.  For the back-end, I created the database for storing the user's Amiibo collection, connected to an API to intelligently display Amiibo photos and information based on applied filters, and data scraped a website with Beautful Soup to retreive news articles based on the user's filters.

Below is a lot of my back-end work.  I also have my work sorted by date in this repo and a Summary folder to see everything in one area.
